# House Price Prediction Model

This Flask web application predicts house prices based on various input parameters such as the number of BHK, bathrooms, area, and more. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate price estimates, aiming to assist users in making informed real estate decisions.

## Overview

The application is built using Flask and has a single-page layout. It allows users to input parameters related to a house and get a predicted price based on a trained machine learning model.

## Features

- **Prediction Page**:
  - Input fields for parameters like BHK, bathrooms, area, etc.
  - Real-time prediction of house prices based on user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Web Server**: NGINX (for deployment)
- **Machine Learning**: Regression models for predicting house prices

## Data Sources

The application utilizes datasets related to house prices. Data preprocessing details are included in the project repository.

## Model Training

The predictive models employed in the application are trained using machine learning algorithms. Model training specifics can be located in the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.
